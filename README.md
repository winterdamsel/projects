Where I'll post my mini projects

This is a repository to keep all my codecademy projects:
<br>
- sdmts.star - This is my widget for Tidbyt, so that I can get bus times here.
<br>
- matches (Foopelganger) - This is a little script in Python to show food items that look in different cuisines. One can get details on certain foods, check what dishes from a certain country might have doppelgangers, or add new items to the list. This one contains a Food clase to hold the structure for each food item, and a dictionary to store all foods.
